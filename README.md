The tests and code created currently lack sophistication and do not adhere to established best practices. Enhancements can be made by incorporating assertions and establishing a well-defined set of requirements. For example, the 'Rover' class could undergo updates to furnish information about its current position and facing direction. This modification would enable us to assert the alignment of the current and expected positions based on a given set of instructions. Additional improvements could also be made to the code to describe the Rover's movement from its initialization position (5,5) to (1,2,N).
